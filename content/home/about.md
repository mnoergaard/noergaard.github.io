Martin Norgaard is a postdoctoral researcher in theÂ [Department of Psychology at Stanford University](https://psychology.stanford.edu/). His research is aimed towards trying to understand (1) where the variation in a neuroimaging experiment comes from, (2) how can we detect it, (3) how do the choices that we make (e.g. subject selection, acquisition and preprocessing) affect the subsequent neuroscientific conclusions that we make, and (4) how can we build tools and software that can help researchers with (1-3). Martin is also heavily involved in data sharing initiatives, standardization/evaluation of workflows for PET brain imaging, and developing the BIDS standard for PET imaging.
