How can society trust the results that come out of research? In the past decade, there has been a growing concern about the validity and reproducibility of produced findings in brain research (“reproducibility crisis in science”), and this has largely been attributed to low statistical power, unexplained variation in the brain data, and flexible data analysis strategies. By uncovering how variations in the brain data affect our ability to predict psychiatric disorders such as depression, this project aims to minimize the negative societal impact of erroneous research results by creating reliable prediction algorithms, as borrowed from the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). The performance of prediction algorithms crucially relies on the quality and the size of the data used for its training. For example, if women are more easily diagnosed with depression than men, or if males are less susceptible to taking their antidepressant medication, then these variations in the data will be reproduced by the prediction algorithm predicting who should be diagnosed and with what treatment form. Regarding the quality, the data may be influenced by underlying factors such as the training level of the doctor, and an inexperienced doctor will be more likely to provide the wrong treatment, whereas a more skilled doctor will be more certain about the treatment form. Finally, regarding the size of the data, if the number of cases in the training data is low (i.e. low sample size), the predictive performance is not likely to generalize to the rest of the population. In this project, we will therefore, in a collaborative effort between data scientists, psychologists, medical doctors and software developers, examine variations in the data and formalize how the effect of unexplained variations can be minimized. As unreliable predictive algorithms may generate public mistrust, our goal is to optimize predictive performance by identifying reliable biomarkers of brain dynamics in depression using a big dataset (N = 420) obtained from 13 different neuroimaging centers worldwide.
